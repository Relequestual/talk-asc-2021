# ASC 2021 generate code images

This project holds the code resources used in my API Specifications Conference 2021 talk on JSON Schema.

Volta is used to pin node and yarn, but is not required.

Once cloned, run `yarn run gen-images`.

This command will generate the images from the source folder.

You can fork this repo and generate your own images from your own source for your own talk.

It uses carbon.sh's CLI tool, `carbon-now-cli`. Unfortunatly it seems to be no longer maintained, but is good enough.
